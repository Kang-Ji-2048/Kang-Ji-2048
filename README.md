## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2nd year student at UCL studying Bsc Data Science

### Projects and fun competitions
TSP modelling for Badminton footwork (Ant algorithm, simulated annealing, Concorde) FILE HERE
MySQL Charity Database Design for Tracking SDGs FILE HERE
CanSat competition in conjunction with ESA
Linear Analysis of Archivex physics papers
Themepark Modelling with Python
Basic board game bot design
Interactive Discord bot for a text based game

### Current interests
I really like machine learning/general algorithm approaches that either take inspiration from nature (eg ant algorithm) or are elegant in their simplicity (eg, MENACE)
/h
I'm currently working on ethical webscraping for general information (ASDHASDJAS)
I'm interested in generating functions and the way they're able to efficiently store information as well as their capacity to act as unique identifiers, I am also interested in approaches/corrections for (arbitrary) decisions, such as the 5% significance level
Outside of stats and coding, I enjoy baking, playing badminton and taking long walks

### Learning
I'm currently learning (ethical) webscraping in python, in particular with BeautifulSoup4 And Selenium

### Skills and Qualifications
Well versed in 
- Python (Machine learning, data wrangling, webscraping)
- R (Modelling, data wrangling)
- SQL (Database design, implementation and queries)
