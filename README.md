## Hi there 👋

I'm a 2nd year student at UCL studying Bsc Data Science, I really like machine learning/general algorithm approaches that either take inspiration from nature (eg the Ant algorithm) or are elegant in their simplicity (eg, MENACE). I'm also interested in generating functions and the way they're able to efficiently store information as well as their capacity to act as unique identifiers, I am also interested in approaches/corrections for (arbitrary) decisions, such as the 5% significance level\
Outside of stats and coding, I enjoy baking, playing badminton and taking long walks and spending time with my 🐐

### Projects and fun competitions (in order of value)
- TSP modelling for Badminton footwork (Ant algorithm, simulated annealing, Concorde) FILE HERE
- MySQL Charity Database Design for Tracking SDGs FILE HERE
- CanSat competition in conjunction with ESA
- Linear Analysis of Archivex physics papers
- Themepark Modelling with Python

### Learning 🎓
I'm currently learning (ethical) webscraping in python, in particular with BeautifulSoup4 And Selenium

### Skills and Qualifications

Coding side
- Python (Machine learning, data wrangling, webscraping)
- R (Modelling, data wrangling)
- SQL (Database design, implementation and queries)

Statistics Side
- Multivariate linear regression 
- Stochastic processes (with a particular interest in Markov chain modelling)
- Standard 1st year statistics (Confidence intervals, generating functions, Classical and Bayesian approaches to probability)

I also have a cloud practicitioners qualification for AWS, and attended a cybersecurity course subsidised by GCHQ for 2021 and 2022
