## Hi there 👋

I'm a 2nd year Bsc Data Science student at UCL, I really like machine learning/general algorithm approaches that either take inspiration from nature (eg the Ant algorithm) or are otherwise elegant in their approach (eg, MENACE). I'm also interested in the way generating functions are able to store so much information as well as their uniqueness. I am also interested in approaches/corrections for (arbritrary) decisions, such as the 5% significance level and various corrections.\
Outside of stats and coding, I enjoy baking, playing badminton and taking long walks and spending time with my 🐐

### Projects and fun competitions (in order of value)
- TSP modelling for Badminton footwork (Ant algorithm, simulated annealing, Concorde) 
- Hospital General Information and statistics scraping and data wrangling (Mainly BS4 and Selenium for scraping and pandas for wrangling)
- CanSat competition with The European Space Agency (ESA)
- MYSQL Charity database design and implementation for tracking SDGs 
- Statistical analysis of ArXiv physics papers over time 
- Themepark modelling with Python (OOP)

### Learning 🎓
I am currently learning about (ethical) webscraping in my free time as well as trying to bake a souffle.\
I am also trying to 

### Skills and Qualifications

Coding languages
- Python (Machine learning, Webscraping, OOP)
- R (Modelling, data wrangling, pretty graphs :) )
- SQL (Database design, implementation and queries)
- HTML (Basic webpage design)

Statistics Side
- Multivariate linear regression 
- Stochastic processes (with a particular interest in Markov chain modelling)
- Standard 1st year statistics (Confidence intervals, generating functions, Classical and Bayesian approaches to probability, etc)
- Standard 1st year mathematics (Multivariable calculus, linear algebra, etc)

I also have a cloud practicitioners qualification for AWS, and attended a cybersecurity course subsidised by GCHQ for 2021 and 2022
