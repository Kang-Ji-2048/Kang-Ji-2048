## Hi there üëã

üéì 2nd year **BSc Data Science student at UCL**  
ü§ñ Passionate about **machine learning, optimization algorithms**, and **nature-inspired algorithms**  
üå± Exploring **NLP (Numind-related)** and advanced **Markov chain modelling**  
üçû Outside of stats and coding, I enjoy baking, playing badminton, and walking with my üêê

### üöÄ Projects & Competitions

- üè∏ **TSP Modelling for Badminton Footwork**  
  Optimized badminton footwork using **Simulated Annealing**, **Ant Colony Optimization**, and **Concorde solver**.

- üè• **Hospital Information Scraper & Data Wrangling**  
  Automated data collection with **Selenium + BeautifulSoup**, and processed 10k+ hospital stats using **pandas**.

- üå≤ **Anomaly Detection with Random Forests**  
  Built a machine learning pipeline for identifying outliers in structured datasets.

- üõ∞Ô∏è **CanSat Competition (ESA)**  
  Designed, built, and deployed a mini-satellite with onboard sensors in collaboration with the **European Space Agency**.

- üåç **Charity Database (MySQL)**  
  Designed and implemented a **relational database** for tracking NGO projects and progress towards the **UN SDGs**.

- üì∞ **NLP Article Data Extraction**  
  Built pipelines using **HuggingFace** and **NuExtract** for extracting structured insights from unstructured articles.



### üìö Currently Learning
- Advanced NLP pipelines (Numind, HuggingFace)  
- Probabilistic modelling & Markov processes
