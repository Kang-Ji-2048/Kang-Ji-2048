## Hi there 👋

I'm a 2nd year Bsc Data Science student at UCL, I  like machine learning/general algorithm approaches that either take inspiration from nature (eg the Ant algorithm) or are otherwise elegant in their approach (eg, MENACE).\
Outside of stats and coding, I enjoy baking, playing badminton and taking long walks and spending time with my 🐐

### Projects and fun competitions
- TSP modelling for Badminton footwork (Simulated annealing, Ant algorithm, Concorde) 
- Hospital General Information and statistics scraping and data wrangling (Mainly BS4 and Selenium for scraping and pandas for wrangling)
- Anomaly detection through random forest
- CanSat competition with The European Space Agency (ESA)
- MYSQL Charity database design and implementation for tracking progress towards SDGs 
- Data Extraction from articles using NLPs and pipelines (HuggingFace, NuExtract)

### Learning 🎓
Currently, I am learning more about NLPs (specifically Numind related)

### Skills and Qualifications

Coding languages
- Python (Machine learning, webscraping, NLPs)
- R (Modelling, data wrangling, pretty graphs :) )
- SQL (Database design, implementation, queries)
- HTML (Basic webpage design)

Statistics Side
- Multivariate linear regression 
- Stochastic processes (with a particular interest in Markov chain modelling)
- Standard 1st year statistics (Confidence intervals, generating functions, Classical and Bayesian approaches to probability, etc)
- Standard 1st year mathematics (Multivariable calculus, linear algebra, etc)

### Favourite Quotes :)

> All models are wrong, some are useful - George Box \
> Can I actually do work please?
